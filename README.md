### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Anna is a product designer who specializes in crafting complex designs, prototyping, and usability testing. <br><br>
âš¡ Do I code? Yes, not like a pro but can be a pro with Generative AI chatbots ;) <br>
I am more proficient in HTML and CSS, a little bit in Java and JavaScript.
